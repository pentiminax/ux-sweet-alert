# Installation

Before you start, make sure you have StimulusBundle configured in your app.

Install the bundle using Composer and Symfony Flex:

```bash
composer require pentiminax/ux-sweet-alert
```

If you're using WebpackEncore, install your assets and restart Encore (not needed if you're using AssetMapper):

```bash
npm install --force
npm run watch

# or use yarn
yarn install --force
yarn watch
```
